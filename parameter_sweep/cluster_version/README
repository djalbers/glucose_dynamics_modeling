this directory contains the code that will integrate the sturgis
glucose/insulin model that will sweep though a choosen parameter and will
create a directory and output files with nutrition and simulated glucose
values. the code is only stupidly parallelized and is written to run on a
torque cluster.

the parameter choices include:


1 - plasma volume V_p; 2 - insulin volume V_i; 3 - glucose space V_g;
4 - E exchange rate for insulin between remote and plasma
compartments; 5 - I_G feeding rate THIS IS SET VIA THE FEEDING
SCHEMES; 6 - t_p time constant for plasma insulin degredation; 6 - t_i
time constant for remote insulin - degredation; 7 - t_d delay between
plasma insulin and glucose production; - 8 - R_m; 9 - a_1 constant in
f_1; 10 - C_1; 11 - C_2; 12 - C_3; 13 - C_4; - 14 - C_5; 15 - U_b; 16
- U_0; 17 - U_m; 18 - R_g; 19 - alpha; 20 - beta.
 
the nominal values are set to the defaults as given in the sturgis paper.


given the following nutrition schemes:

 1 - continous feeding, 2 - square feeding function, 3 - pulse feeding
 with decay, 4 - random levels of continous feeding (for a
 population), 6 - noisy but structured (three meals a day near 8 am,
 12 pm and 6 pm) mealtimes, pulse with decay, 7 - random breakfast,
 then retain structured time between meals, pulse with decay, 8 -
 random meal times, pulse with decay, 9 - random breakfast, retain
 time between meals, pulse with decay, differing feeding rates (for
 the population)

many of these simulations are discussed in the forthcoming artical by albers
and hripcsak titled dynamical phenotyping

matlab_utilities: contains code written by others required to run the
submission script

submit_glucose.m: matlab script that submits the glucose parameter sweep to
the torque matlab cluster.

glucose_insulin.m: function that integrates the sturgis model.

feeding.m: function that controls the nutrition for the individual or
population --- the feeding regimen is set by a parameter in
integrate_plot_glucose_DEMO.

artifical_patient_glucose.data: an output file of glucose values created by
integrate_plot_glucose_DEMO.  the format of the file is a matrix:
identifier time glucose value

food.data: a data file that defines the nutrition for the individual or
population.
