this MATLAB code simulates the glucose/insulin model discussed in
Sturgis et al.

the src is split into two categories:

standard_mulit_nutrition: the source in this directory represent the
standard, basic code for simulating glucose/insulin dynamics using
different nutrition regimens and population compostions.  this code
will output data files that document both the glucose and the
nutrition in time.

parameter_sweep: the source in this directory represent the
glucose/insulin dynamics under parameter variation.  this source
itself is split into two versions, cluster and non-cluster
versions. both versions run essentially the same scripts and
functions; the cluster version is meant to run on a beowulf cluster
with matlab and a queue (e.g., torque) where many parameters are
varied; the non-cluster version is meant to run on any machine and
varies a single parameter at a time.
