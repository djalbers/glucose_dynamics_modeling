this directory contains a code that will integrate the sturgis
glucose/insulin model given the following nutrition schemes:

 1 - continous feeding, 2 - square feeding function, 3 - pulse feeding
 with decay, 4 - random levels of continous feeding (for a
 population), 6 - noisy but structured (three meals a day near 8 am,
 12 pm and 6 pm) mealtimes, pulse with decay, 7 - random breakfast,
 then retain structured time between meals, pulse with decay, 8 -
 random meal times, pulse with decay, 9 - random breakfast, retain
 time between meals, pulse with decay, differing feeding rates (for
 the population)

many of these simulations are discussed in:

integrate_plot_glucose_DEMO.m: a script that calls the strugis glucose model
and creates two data files, documented below.  the parameter settings are
outlined in the script.

glucose_insulin.m: function that integrates the sturgis model.

feeding.m: function that controls the nutrition for the individual or
population --- the feeding regimen is set by a parameter in
integrate_plot_glucose_DEMO.

artifical_patient_glucose.data: an output file of glucose values created by
integrate_plot_glucose_DEMO.  the format of the file is a matrix:
identifier time glucose value

food.data: a data file that defines the nutrition for the individual or
population.

basic_statistics: simple, basics statistical analyses of the output of the
glucose and nutrition time series (food.data,
artifical_glucose_time_series.data).
